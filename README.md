# DutchWordGame
Simple Word Game for Studying Dutch

It's like Wordle, except it's not at all. The words can be any length, and you can guess as many times as you like. 
It just shows you what letters you got correct, and if letters are in the wrong or right place.

While playing, type 3 to end the game. Type 2 to skip the word and get the answer.
You'll see how many letters you're missing, and which letters were correctly guessed.

The Dictionary contains a list of 1000 most commonly used Dutch words.

Wrote this game just to see if I still remember how to use PowerShell, and it's just like riding a bike. Fun.
